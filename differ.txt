Difference between var , let and const

----> var
1. var is global, functional and local scope.
2. var can be redeclared and updated
   Example : 
   var a = 10;
   var b = 20; //redclared Example

   var a = 20;
   a = 30; //updated.
3. Hoisting of the var is possible.
4. Problem of var is redeclared because you did not declared one variable multiple time in industrial code.


----> let
1. let is blocked scope.
2. let can be updated but not redeclared
   Example : 
   let a = 20;
   a = 30; //updated.
3. Hoisting can be done but in the case of let it is not initalize


----> const
1. const is blocked scope.
2. const cannot be updated and redeclared.
   Example :
   const a = 20;
3. Hoisting can be done but in the case of const it is not initalize
